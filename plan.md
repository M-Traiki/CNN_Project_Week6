Please follow these instructions to complete the first part of the Deep Learning project (CNN part):

#### Load the CIFAR-10 dataset

Load it as we did with the Fashion MNIST and MNIST datasets in the lesson notebooks. Create visualizations of some sample images and their corresponding labels.

#### Preprocess your data

Apply normalization, reshaping, label encoding, and resizing as needed.

#### Design your CNN models

Start with a simple architecture, then experiment by increasing the number of layers, filters, and other parameters.

#### Train your models

Train at least two different CNN architectures. You can fine-tune hyperparameters such as the number of epochs (consider using early stopping), batch size, and learning rate.

#### Evaluate your models

Report metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and visualize the confusion matrix to analyze class-wise performance.
In this part, you should train and compare at least two different CNN models based on their performance.
